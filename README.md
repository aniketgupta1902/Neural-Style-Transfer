# Neural-Style-Transfer using VGG19 CNN model
DATASET used- Best Artworks of all time , Google Scrapped Image Dataset and VGG19 model https://www.kaggle.com/basu369victor/style-transfer-deep-learning-algorithm#data 

This project is based on taking two input images - content and style image and generating an output art image by blending the content image and style image together.
The output image looks like the content image(input image) but painted in the style of style image.
CNN model will be used to generate new arts for each content image
and style image as input. 
Also Selenium is used for scraping images .
This model can be used by the artists to generate new Arts without having any Intellectual Property Right issues.

1. Python-Numpy,Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Tensorflow
5. Keras
6. Flask for website
7. Waitress Serve
